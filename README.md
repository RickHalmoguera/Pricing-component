## My process

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I practiced Event Listener, specifically the change one, which executes a function every time there is a change in the element that we indicate

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```js
const changePrice = ()=>{

    if( checkbox.checked){

        basicPriceDisplay.innerText = priceMonthly[0]
        proPriceDisplay.innerText = priceMonthly[1]
        masterPriceDisplay.innerText = priceMonthly[2]
    
    }else{
    
        basicPriceDisplay.innerText = priceAnnually[0]
        proPriceDisplay.innerText = priceAnnually[1]
        masterPriceDisplay.innerText = priceAnnually[2]
    }

}

checkbox.addEventListener("change", changePrice)
}
```
